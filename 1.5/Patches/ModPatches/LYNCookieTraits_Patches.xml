<Patch><!--Haven't tried this mod out before. The ideas seemed alright, and I had fun playing with it, but looking at the XML, I have comments:
	Psionic: a 0.2 offset to PsychicEntropyMax is... nothing. That should presumably be either a much larger integer value, or a 1.2x multiplier.
	Fighter: modifying the MeleeDPS and MeleeArmorPenetration stats does nothing. This trait literally only adds 2 melee.
	Lone Wolf: should presumably have +50% pain shock threshold, not -50%.-->

				<!--I would like Fighter to work, so I made it work. I have to work on assumptions here as to what Lyn the Cookie wanted to boost w/ Melee DPS, but I chose melee damage instead of melee
					attack speed because VEF's melee attack speed factor doesn't work on unarmed attacks for some reason.
					The others be on LadyCookie to fix as she sees fit, since such fixes don't require any other mods.-->
